# Homework: Add Wagtail to your website

> Part of this chapter is based on Wagtailâ€™s official [Getting Started tutorial](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/getting_started/tutorial.html).

We can make our blog even more professional by adding Wagtail to our website while at the same time we are
developing our coding skills in Python and Django. Wagtail is an open source content management system built on 
Django, with a strong community and commercial support. It's focused on user experience, 
and offers precise control for designers and developers.

The website we built through following the tutorial is a simplified content management system because it allows us
to add and manage content as well as serve it to the visitors of our blog. Wagtail on the other hand is a more complex 
content management system with more advanced features. Adding Wagtail to our website will enable us to learn more about 
Django and see what cool applications we can build with it.

In this part of the tutorial, we will cover the following aspects:
- [Installing Wagtail and Configuring Wagtail](install_wagtail/README.md)
- [Adding the Homepage](wagtail_integration_adding_homepage/README.md)
- [Adding Posts](wagtail_integration_adding_posts/README.md)
- [Change Website Homepage](change_website_homepage/README.md)

So let's get started!
